# Bob's Little Free Library 

Bob's Little Free Library is a book sharing app created as the term project for [CMPUT 301 - Intro to Software Engineering ](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/introduction-to-software-engineering.html) in Fall of 2020. The app is for a community of readers that want to upload, borrow, lend, and exchange each other's books with ease. Take a look at a short demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G78mErhBzyJEwKd62OLz0UABxwjl0JgC/view?usp=sharing) where two users, Mari and Lucas, go through the process of adding, requesting, and then exchanging a book. This demo showcases the UI design and the basic features of the app, a comprehensive list of it's features can be found below.

### Sign Up 

### Adding a book
To add a book a user can either scan or enter the isbn from the back of the book, this will automatically get all the book's information like the title, author, and description. The user can also enter this information manually if they choose and if any they make any mistakes can easily go back and edit the book. They can then either select an existing image on their device, or take a new image to attach to this book. 

### Searching for a Book

### Requesting and Exchanging a Book
To request a book a user needs to click on a book that is not theirs, either by searching or from the "Latest Books" section on the home page. If the book has not been accepted or borrowed yet, the user can scroll down to the bottom of the page and hit the "Request Book" button to request the book. For exchanging a book, either the owner of the book needs to accept the request or the borrower needs to request to return the book. After selecting a location and confirming, both parties will meet at the specified location with the book and both parties need to scan the book using the "Quick Scan" function on the home page in order to exchange the book and update the status of the book in the app.
